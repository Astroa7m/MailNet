1- ModuleNotFoundError:
    * Caused:
    - When running the MCP server (within a module), and it tries to access other files/imports from different modules
    - Python couldn’t resolve sibling modules (api, email_client, etc.) when the working directory was misaligned.
    - Claude’s config used --directory pointing to a subfolder (mcp_launcher), breaking import resolution.
    * Solution:
    - Add '__init__.py' to MailNet, api/, email_client/, mcp_launcher/
    - This enabled us to resolve the imports when running the server by 'uv run -m mcp_launcher.server'
    - Used claude config:
        ```"email_mcp": {
          "command": "uv",
          "args": [
            "--directory",
            "path\\to\\project-MailNet",
            "run",
            "-m",
            "mcp_launcher.server"
          ]
        }```
      * Notes:
      - '--directory' sets the working directory to the project root, so Python can resolve all sibling modules.
      - '-m mcp_launcher.server' runs the server as a module, not a script, enabling proper import resolution.
      - MCP tooling (uv run mcp dev ...) works best when the server is launched as a module from the root.
      - Avoid 'uv run mcp dev mcp_launcher/server.py'  # breaks imports
      - "--directory": "path\\to\\project-MailNet\\mcp_launcher"  # breaks sibling imports
